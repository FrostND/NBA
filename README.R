# In this demonstration we will leverage hx NBA data to predict the outcome 
# of NBA games. Our goal will be to develop a model that is more accurate 
# than other models and better than our subjective picks.

# Data sources: 
# 1. NBA play-by-play data
# 2. NBA player statistics
#   ~ NBA player rating PER
#   ~ FiveThirtyEight player rating: RAPTOR
# 3. NBA team box scores
