# The purpose of this project is to leverage hx 
# NBA data to predict the outcome of NBA games. The
# goal is to create a statistical model that is more
# accurate than other models and more accurate than 
# subjective picks.

# Data sources: 
# 1. play-by-play data
# 2. player statistics
#   - NBA player rating PER
#   - FiveThirtyeight player rating RAPTOR
# 3. team box scores

# - predictions better than chance (50/50) 
# - predictions better than subjective picks 
# - predictions better than other models 
# - predictions better than Vegas odds
